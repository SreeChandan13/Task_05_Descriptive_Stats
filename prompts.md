10. "As a coach, if I wanted to win two more games this coming season, should I focus on offense or defense based on this season's stats, and if so, what is one player I should work with to be a game-changer and why?"

**Attempted Answer:** Based on the 2023 season stats, Syracuse had a much higher goal-scoring average (16.05 goals per game) than their opponents (9.57 goals per game). This suggests a strong offense. The team also had a winning record of 18-3. While both offense and defense are crucial, the significant difference in goals scored versus allowed (337 for Syracuse vs. 201 for opponents)  indicates offensive dominance. However, determining whether focusing on offense or defense would definitively lead to "two more wins" is a complex predictive analysis that cannot be directly concluded from these descriptive statistics alone. This data describes what did happen, not a causal relationship for future outcomes.

**Regarding a "game-changer" player:** The term "game-changer" requires a qualitative definition that is not present in the quantitative statistics. If a "game-changer" is defined as the player with the highest total points, then Meaghan Tyrrell, with 107 points (55 Goals, 52 Assists), could be considered. Working with her might further boost offensive output. If "game-changer" relates to defensive impact, Katie Goodale has high caused turnovers (27) , or Delaney Sweitzer has a high number of draw controls (78). Without a clear metric for "game-changer" and how it directly impacts future wins, selecting one player as a "game-changer" to achieve "two more wins" is an assumption beyond the scope of the provided descriptive data.


9. Based on the 'Goals by Period' and 'Saves by Period' data, in which quarter does Syracuse's performance (both offensive and defensive) show the most significant change compared to the preceding quarter, and what might be a possible reason for this change?"

**Attempted Answer:**

**Goals by Period (Syracuse):**

1st: 98 

2nd: 90 (Change from 1st: -8) 

3rd: 85 (Change from 2nd: -5) 

4th: 64 (Change from 3rd: -21) 

Saves by Period (Syracuse):

1st: 53 

2nd: 51 (Change from 1st: -2) 

3rd: 51 (Change from 2nd: 0) 

4th: 36 (Change from 3rd: -15) 

**Analyzing the changes:**
Syracuse's offensive performance (goals) shows the most significant decrease from the 3rd quarter (85 goals) to the 4th quarter (64 goals), a drop of 21 goals.

Syracuse's defensive performance (saves) also shows the most significant decrease from the 3rd quarter (51 saves) to the 4th quarter (36 saves), a drop of 15 saves.

Thus, the 4th quarter shows the most significant decline in both offensive and defensive output compared to its preceding quarter.

**Possible Reason:** The provided statistical data does not offer any context or qualitative information to explain why these changes occur. Any reason would be purely speculative and outside the scope of the given numbers (e.g., fatigue, strategic changes by opponents, or playing against tougher teams in the 4th quarter, but this is not supported by the data).
